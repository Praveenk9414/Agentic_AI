    "What is LangGraph\n",
    "• LangGraph is an orchestration framework for building intelligent, stateful, and multi-step LLM workflows.\n",
    "• It enables advanced features like parallelism, loops, branching, memory, and resumability — making it ideal for agentic and production-grade Al applications.\n",
    "• It models your logic as a graph of nodes (tasks) and edges (routing) instead of a linear chain.\n",

    "What is LLM workflow ->\n",
    "\n",
    "1. LLM workflows are a step by step process using which we can build complex\n",
    "LLM applications.\n",
    "2. Each step in a workflow performs a distinct task - such as prompting, reasoning, tool calling, memory access, or decision-making.\n",
    "3. Workflows can be linear, parallel, branched, or looped, allowing for complex behaviours like retries, multi-agent communication, or tool-augmented reasoning.\n",
    "4. Common workflows\n",

    "In prompt chaining it checks for certain conditions to be meet (for e.g; 5000 word limit) ... and exits ... its has a continous chain like structure\n",

    "In Parallelization ... The task are divided into subtasks ... like lets say we have a youtube content moderater which perfrom the task of checking whether the video is appropriate or not ... all these task work in parallel (community guideline check, misinformation, sexual content...) and based on that the aggregator decide the result... \n",
